1. 🎯 RPA Challenge - 1
📝 Original Task:
The initial task was to automate the process of filling out the RPA Challenge Portal using data from an Excel file. The process included:

Manually downloading the raw input file.

Removing empty rows before processing.

Populating data into the portal and capturing a success snapshot after completion.

🚀 Enhancements Implemented:
File Management Automation: Added a flow to check if the raw input file already exists in the folder. If the file is present, the bot reads it directly; otherwise, it downloads the latest file from the portal.

Exception Handling & Logging: Implemented a comprehensive exception handling mechanism that logs errors and captures snapshots in case of any failure.

Improved Logging Framework: Designed a logger flow to maintain detailed logs for each step of the process, ensuring traceability and easier debugging.

Final Process Snapshot: Ensured a snapshot is captured after successful process completion to validate and review the output.

⚡ How I Completed It:
Used Power Automate Desktop (PAD) to automate file handling, Excel data processing, and portal interaction.

Integrated conditional logic to check file existence and dynamically download files when necessary.

Configured exception handling to capture errors at different stages and log them along with relevant snapshots.

📈 Overall Outcome:
These enhancements significantly reduced manual intervention, improved error traceability, and increased the overall reliability of the process. The bot now handles the entire workflow smoothly, ensuring accurate data processing and error-free completion.
